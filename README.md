# Tech-Blog MVC
## I was motivated to create an application that users can blog about tech.

## I built this application so I can utilize the CRUD operaction, to deploy my first MVC and use the handlebars technology

* one problem this solves is an MVC method provides a blueprint for an application that has a database to communicate with the front-end

* users will be able to create posts, and it will be able to be read by other users, and the user with the post can update that post or delete it.

* With this application I can use databases for my applications so I can give the user more continuity, and immerse them more into my application.

## I learned The Model-View-Controller setup method to use futher on in my applications, And I learned the connectivity with back-side and front-end how it develops further compared to modern applications.

## This application stands out from my previous applications as it gives more order and readablity to my application so I can give more to the user, and provides a framework for connecting back-end and front-end sides
